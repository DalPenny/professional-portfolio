# Advanced-CSS-Challenge-Professional-Portfolio


## Description

The motivation to build this Portfolio was to have a central, easy accessible location for all my work.
I built this project so that it's easier to pull up as references for what i have accomplished in my career. 
This project solves the problem of not having a centralized, easy to access location for all my work.
I learned how to make my own webpage, and how to make it look good with colors and images and text. I learned how to create links to different sections in the page, as well as how to link to my Linkedin and Github accounts.


## Installation

Use HTML and CSS to build this application
Used github and VSCode tools

Once application is tested, deploy to github
Github link is shared here 


## Usage

This application will be used as a repository for future work and to provide info about me  


## Features

Used HTML and CSS to build this professional portfolio application which will be used for my future coding projects and for future job applications

Divided the site into three sections/navigation links (about me, work, contact me) to ensure it was easy to navigate

Added a link to my resume at the top

Added a recent photo of me in the first section of the page and added a quote to fill the empty space

In the My Work section, i included my code refactor and this portfolio

Added spaces for the future projects, up to nine

When Code refactor project or Portfolio project is clicked on, it will take the user to the respective applications

The page was styled so that it could fit in multiple device size (phone, tablet, laptop/desktop) 

Included hover effects over the links so that you can tell its a link and can be clicked on
